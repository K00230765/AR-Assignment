AR Assignment
K00230765 – Aaron Boyd
The theme I choose for the AR Assignment was based on a dragon/mystical theme. I made a poster, which was the target, in illustrator. 
I decided to use a green egg which I downloaded from google images which I felt looked most like a dragon egg. I then added some 
colours around it and messed around until I could find colours that would best suit the egg colour. 
The lighter shade of purple which gradually grows from the white colour which is behind the egg is used to add some sort of glowing effect 
to show the user this should be their main focus. After that then it was just a darker shade of purple.

Once the phone is targeting the target, which is the poster, a dragon will appear and it will be doing a flying animation on an 
endless loop. I downloaded the dragon from a website called ‘Sketch Fab’ and once everything was imported, 
I had to add the textures to the dragon which I felt best suited and add and edit the flying animation so it would do what I wanted it do.

When opening the unity file, you must go to 'Assets/Import/Drache/animations/' in the project folder and then unzip the 'flying.anim' folder 
so the flying animation will carry out. This was needed to be zipped due to the file being too big to upload to github.
